title: The Unix Shell
---
Welcome to Unix / bash command line. There is no mouse required, it's all done via keyboard. Unix has been around since the 70's and it is still (in the form of Linux) the leadiong OS for high-performance computers. Pre-cursors of bash have been part of it since Day 1. It has survived so long because it's a power tool that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes. More importantly, it helps them combine existing programs in new ways and automate repetitive tasks so that they don't have to type the same things over and over again. Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools and computing resources (including "high-performance computing" supercomputers). These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.

At the end of this lesson, you should know all of the basics of using a computer through the command-line and be able to use cloud computing resources like those hosted by the Centre for Advanced Computing.
